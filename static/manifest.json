This is the forecast I’m using to predict <a href='https://www.metaculus.com/questions/17721/north-atlantic-ace-on-sep-30-2023/' target='_blank'>this question</a> in Metaculus’s quarterly forecasting tournament. There is no meteorological significance of Sep. 30th, this is just the end date for the tournament.</p><p>My forecast is based entirely off of the Colorado State University <a href='https://tropical.colostate.edu/forecasting.html' target='_blank'>Tropical Meteorology Project forecasts</a> for this year. I use their 2023 full-season forecast (which includes a median estimate and error bands), combined with historical averages (from 1991 - 2020) to produce a daily estimate.
